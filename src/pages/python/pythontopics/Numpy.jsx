        <h3><b>Need of Numpy:</b></h3>
        <p>As the part of Data Science, Machine Learining, Deep Learning it is the very common requirement to perform complex mathematical operations like : </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Creation of Array/Matrices</li>
                <li>Perform several operations on array/matrices</li>
                <li>Perform integral calculus operations</li>
                <li>Solving Differential equations</li>
                <li>Statistics related operations etc</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            To perform these complex mathematical operations, python does not contain any inbuilt library.
            <br />To perform these complex operations we require a library which is nothing but numpy.
